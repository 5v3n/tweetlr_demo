# tweetlr_demo

A demonstration on how easy you're able to set up your own tweetlr twitter to tumblr image crawler. 

# ok, tell me more

This demo and a tumblr account is all you need to start a full blown fulltext search on twitter for tweets containing... erm... 'cat'. And post pics that are linked in the results to the tumblelog you configured in the `config/tweetlr.yml`.

# wow, I'm stoked! but there-s a little feature missing...

Check (tweetlr)[http://github.com/5v3n/tweetlr] for feature requests, bug reports and, of course, some contribution action.

Enjoy!
